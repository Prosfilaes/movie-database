This is a ball of code that I wrote to create and manage my own DVD
database. I didn't really find anything I liked pre-made, and I'm
entirely okay with coding up SQL, despite (or because) of the fact
that I had to learn SQL to code this.

This code is released under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version.

I can't find anything that will explain exactly how a MOBI or AZW
file is made, which is really the ultimate target, but I can convert
the HTML for my Kindle. The HTML code clearly needs some cleaning 
to make it production worthy; it's in the "everything requires a
code change" stage right now.
